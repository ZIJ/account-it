Index page - empty room. User can add operations and participants, save the room (in this case it gets a public link) and access it later.

Each operation has amount and one or more participants. Each participant in a particular operation has:
- Amount that he paid
- Amount that he has to pay. It can be set manually (i.e. from a receipt) or calculated automatically from total amount (shared between other participants with undefined credit)


### Collaboration flow

Public rooms are fully accessible for anybody with the link. A signed-in user can "bookmark" any public room (how?)

Private rooms can only be created by signed-in users.

Sign in options:
- username + password
- email + password
- social services

An authorized user can manage his sign-in options â€“ add or remove social services. When user adds a social account, all rooms associated with that account are merged to user's profile. When removing an account, it does not get any rooms, even if some of them were previously associated with it.
