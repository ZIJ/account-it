Index page - empty room. User can add operations and participants, save the room (in this case it gets a public link) and access it later as owner.

Each operation has amount and one or more participants. Each participant in a particular operation has:
- Amount that he paid
- Amount that he has to pay. It can be set manually (i.e. from a receipt) or calculated automatically from total amount (shared between other participants with undefined credit)


### Collaboration flow

Public rooms are fully accessible for anybody with the link. A signed-in user can "bookmark" any public room.

Private rooms can only be created by signed-in users.

Sign in options:
- username + password
- email + password
- social services

An authorized user can manage his sign-in options â€“ add or remove social services. When user adds a social account, all rooms associated with that account are merged to user's profile. When removing an account, it affects no rooms, even if some of them were previously associated with it.

When signed in, user can see all private rooms that he created or was invited to, as well as all public rooms that he "bookmarked".


A user can invite other persons to any private room that he created or was invited to. This can be done by invitation link or by email (that contains the same invitation link).

An invitation link has a limited time to live and can be used only once. When another person clicks on that link, he must sign-up or sign-in.

When the invited user is authorized, a person who invited him gets an "approval message" with some info about the user who accepted invitation (username from Account-it or the service that he used to log in).

Until approval, the user who is invited can see the room that he has been invited to in "locked" state with a message about approval process.
